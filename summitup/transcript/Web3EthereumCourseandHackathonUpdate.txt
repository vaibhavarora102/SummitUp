Today's back i did a poll on youtube and i want to know would you like to participate in the hackathon the blockchain hackathon and then after 2 days we got. Round to 3000 votes. And then the waiting is. Majority of you are saying not now we're talking about the 55% of people and 45% people voted for yes they want to participate for the blockchain hackathon. Write the cause in total even if you said 2700 boards. Approximately thousand people want to participate in the hackathon. The coming back to the second part the 55% why they don't want to participate i was wondering what's the reason i don't know about victory maybe they don't know about the programming language which is used to make applications or they are not sure what to do in the high court on specific when it comes to blocked. Nothing is we have multiple blockchain hackathon is coming up and in every blocks and will be having a different technology we all will be having a different problem statement and different prices inside the price will be issued by then we are not doing it for the price is right while doing it for the experience was doing it for the learning purpose. Now in the high court and you'll be getting a problem statement and you'll be getting around 24 hours of 44 as given up on the hackathon. And in the 24 hours you have to stay there at one place you can come solo you can come with a team and you to solve a problem statement. Nothing is can you solve something 24 hours of course will not give your parents it will take one year of course will give your problem statement which you can complete in 24 hours. And it's not like you can do that on one go or maybe you are you are you are coming there for the first time you don't know block and you don't blockchain technology and then you say hey i want to win. No that's not the case but then if you know something if you know how to code in any blockchain technology if you know what what is javascript if you know solid at that that's an advantage. What you can compare. Want to send the statement and solve the problem. And of course this will give you a good learning experience it will give you a different vibe. This will be an offline. What if you don't know the locker technology what is it don't know how to write and application. Thought can we do that can we can we have a mixture here that i can train you on how to make dams and then you can come to the high court on and participate and try to complete a different learning experience write your learning and then you are also implementing so that's why we are starting from this monday and starting with a blockchain course of course this is not a full-fledged boxing course this is where will teach you. How to build dam. But it is a prerequisite for this. You need to know the blockchain technology basic. Blockchain means what is cryptography what is nodes. For that you have to watch my playlist on blockchain it was only has 10 or 12 videos are not sure but then you can complete that in. However the one day tour to by watching the videos 20 stand what blockchain technology is. Use find link in description. Neemuch to complete that from monday we are going to start with ethereum. Because you can't build application on this platform of course we have different ecosystem as well but for this we are going to focus on ethereum and will teach you. Sorry it and we'll build our first dab with this android application. End up doing that you have to participate in the market. Trust me. If you know how to build an application you can come there and tried out because i will be having 24 hours your completely focused on one problem statement. Which team or maybe solo but when you are focused you can achieve great things right. So we plan again that this is a plan for more updates yet to make sure that you subscribe and hit that like. Because youtube sometime is the notification. Light so notification on the hackathons and on the light session is coming up at the timing is not fixed at will update that soon but i wanted to give you some general idea about the hackathon and. The live session on youtube for blockchain. Excited you can see on my face because i'm tired today but i am excited for this live session and i hope you are also get me the comments section. What exactly you want in this life session i will try to achieve that of course. But we have a structure content prepared at least now. But it is something which is interesting will can added in the licence as well. This video see you in the life season coming on monday yes if any confused we also had learning about java live session that will be running in parallel. I will not be doing blockchain from india and arabic maybe we can do all that is java and blockchain. That should work like that to understand the future updates makes when you click on that pal i can't thanks everyone.
