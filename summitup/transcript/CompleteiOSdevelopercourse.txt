And will understand the language basics and how we can write loops and functions in classes in struct in swift and then we will forward into building a lot of apps. Nios my name is tej and i will writing code for almost a decade and have been teaching at. My speciality is to turn the toughest topic in to the easiest one i make learning absolutely fun and enjoyable and that's exactly will be doing in this course. I've been teaching variety of subjects on youtube with around 700 thousand subscribers and constantly growing and this experience has given me a tremendous value of how to teach topic in to the most serious manner. There are couple of prerequisites in this course. Specially you need to have a mac device it can be a macbook air macbook pro or maybe just mac meaning. You do not need an apple device because the apple device or the ios device specially like iphone and ipad they are included in the simulator. But you need to have a mac device which can run the mac os unfortunately this course cannot be completed on windows device. Before you jump into the course make sure you have a mac device. And that's the only prerequisite to get started with programming basics to the app development all of it. And this prerequisite make the world of ios development as a walled garden and this is an opportunity as well. When you see hundreds and thousands of people are applying for jobs of web development and android development there are only a handful of developer who works on ios and this is your chance and your opportunity to jump in the world of ios. This course starts from absolute basics and how we can work through the x code how we can download it and the first look and the tour offer code. After that whether brush up our programming basics will see how the variables and functions in loops and control statement all of this work and how we can use the syntax to solve your basic problems than ever gane jump into some advanced concept of swift concert live classes protocols in arms and a whole lot of colours. These are going to help you to brush up as well as make a strong foundation of the programming basics in swift i am a strong believer that you learn best while building the staff and that's exactly will be doing in this course. This course starts with the app development you will learn the basics of swift and will make it a strong foundation world building app to get started with our very first app the profile app every single app in this course is designed in such a way that it takes down one challenger time. And you build the app and you'll learn a new concept and take down a new challenge for example the first profile app is introduced so that you can understand about the abstract we stack and the least i can can nashta. The very next of the slots appeared in a so that we can nashta how to design custom shapes in ios will learn the basics about the row values identifiable and can build an app which can do some random number generation as well after that we can move into a little bit of animation with calculator. Although allow people face calculator display easy but it's not it teaches you so much about how to calculate the dimensions of a mobile devices the width and height will learn the basics about how to design models will also learn about how we can actually have a button and can do something based on the press of the button then move into the fun and the basic app of splash screen. Whenever you will be working as an ios developer will be building summer splash screen and the next project is going to teach you exactly the same after that you will be the best shopping app no this app brings a lot of things you will learn how we can have a horizontal scroll view a vertical scroll view and can have multiple views that we can design separately and can bring them together this app is really amazing in terms of the ui design and what the core feature of building a sap activate the beautiful and that is exactly where will be focusing a lot in this app since we're talking about the us and the views will be taking the next up health linkedin clone. Believe that if you know and understand that if any design is given to you in sigma or xd or any other to you should have the capability of replicating the design in the code. Once you have that you are automatically cleared your first hurdle of getting the very first job as a junior ios developer. That is why the link and closing is introduced that you can just take a look on the view and can code in out that the ui path is sorted by the move into the path of building at to develop a lot of people looked down at the today but this is not the way you move forward. Afsar equally complex and where can i learn a lot about to do app in this particular section observable userdefault navigation the navigation link and making sure that the state of the entire app is available to each and every view there is so much to learn in this app on top of that will be learning about the third functionality because its state management taking input from the user there is so much that i go and dive deep into the section after that as an ios developer you will be handling tons and tons of api so i have focused specially in depth about how to handle a pears in this section will be building up couple of apps that are 100% focused on api. About it that how we can make a web request and then when the web request comes out how to handle those responses sometimes the responses are pretty good sometimes the responses are dirty see need to learn how to clean those responses and then can make a model according to head. Applicable the model it's time to display all the responses on a beautiful screen as you can see there are tons of apps in this course and these are only just how we're launching this course as a get more time i'll make sure that i add more apps into this course as well as more concepts are being introduced in the course.
